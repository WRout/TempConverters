> JavaScript and Java Temperature Converters

## JavaScript Temperature Converter

This Temperature Converter was my first JavaScript project, and it is a testament to how far I have come in terms of proficiency with the language.

## Java Temperature Converter

This Temperature Converter function in a relatively similar way to the JavaScript one, and it was also similarly one of the first projects I created when I was learning Java.
